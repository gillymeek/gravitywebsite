title: Hello, I'm Gilly Meek

I’m a coach and trainer, [with over fourteen years’ experience](https://uk.linkedin.com/in/gillymeek?title=Read more at my LinkedIn profile)". I founded Gravity eight years ago because I believed there was a better way to inspire and develop managers and leaders.

Since then I have worked around the world with over a hundred different organisations in a wide range of sectors, including media, retail, finance, legal and hospitality.

I provide relevant and practical training courses which I deliver in a memorable and engaging way and I’d love to bring these in to your company.
