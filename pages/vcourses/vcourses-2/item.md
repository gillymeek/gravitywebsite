Our coaching packages will give your organisation the flexibility to train, coach and support a large number of staff in all their different training needs, at a time to suit them.

##### How does it work?

* Your organisation chooses a package of virtual 1-2-1 coaching sessions
* You offer these sessions out to your staff
* You donâ€™t need to book times and dates upfront- bank the sessions and use them as you need them
* We schedule the virtual coaching sessions at a time to suit your staff.
* Each session lasts 50 minutes
* Staff can work on skills development, a current project, decision making, idea generation, resilience or general support!
