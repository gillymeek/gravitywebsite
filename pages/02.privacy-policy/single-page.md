##Who we are {.underline-left}
Gravity Training and Development Ltd, registered in England and Wales, 6693920. Registered office: 71-75 Shelton Street, Covent Garden, London WC2H 9JQ
##How we use data {.underline-left}
We are open about how we use your data. We act as both data controller and processor for certain data, to collect, process and retain personal data in connection with training service delivery, at proposal stage and during contract fulfilment. Data is stored securely with access restrictions imposed as appropriate. All personal data we receive will be processed in accordance with the General Data Protection Regulations.
Our legal basis for collecting, processing and retaining personal data is to allow us to contact you with respect to training/coaching delivery that we pitch for, or undertake to fulfil contractual obligations for clients. Example processing activities include, but are not limited to:
* Communicating with you (clients) in relation to service delivery according to agreed contractual requirements;
* Using personal data to obtain feedback during, at the end of a training course or after a training programme is completed, regarding your opinion of our training delivery.

Where we have asked you to provide data in support of a training programme, we will advise you of the purpose, and how we will process the data. We will process and retain that data only for that purpose and will not use this data for any other reason. We do not share your data with any other third party. You have the right to withdraw your consent from us holding/processing your data at any time by sending us a request to do so on hello@gravity-training.co.uk.
##Data used for other purposes {.underline-left}
We may wish to keep in touch with you regarding your future training needs, inform you of other services we offer, or advise you of promotions and events we may run that we feel would be of legitimate interest to you, but we would seek your permission first to use your data in this way. Otherwise we will not contact you for any other reason than in respect of the training programme for which we obtained your data.
##Data retention {.underline-left}
Unless otherwise directed by you, we will retain your data for the duration of the training project, and then in electronic form only for a period of up to 30 years after project completion, for reference purposes or to address future enquiries on completed work. You have the right to request deletion of your data prior to this. This retention period is subject to legislation changes and periodic review.
